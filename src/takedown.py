Subject: URGENT — Fake {official_display} Impersonator Detected

Dear Team,

We have detected a potentially fraudulent or impersonator application targeting the brand **{official_display}**.

The following suspicious app has been flagged by our Fake App Detection System:

App Details:
- App Name: {app_name}
- Package Name: {package_name}
- Publisher: {publisher}
- Risk Score: {risk_score}/100
- Expected Official Publisher: {official_pub}

Based on multiple indicators (publisher mismatch, naming similarity, suspicious keywords, and typosquatting patterns),
this application is likely attempting to impersonate the legitimate {official_display} app.

We request an immediate review and appropriate action (removal / suspension) to protect users from fraud, phishing,
or unauthorized data collection.

Thank you,
Fake App Detection Team
